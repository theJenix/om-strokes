# om-strokes
An implementation of various strokes tutorials (original or ported) using Om.

Strokes is a ClojureScript interface onto D3.js, a most excellent Javascript visualization library.  See https://github.com/dribnet/strokes for more info.

Om is a fantastic component model framework based on React.

This is my attempt to get my head around Strokes in Om by porting and writing tutorials.  Want to contribute a tutorial?  Fork the code, implement your tutorial in a separate Om component, and send a pull request.

This project was created using the om-starter leiningen template (https://github.com/jalehman/om-starter).
